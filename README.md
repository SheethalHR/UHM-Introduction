# UHM-Introduction
# Ultra high modulus composite material introduction to increase stiffness and cost reduction in WInd trurbine blades.
Background of UHM Glass - Stiffness of composite material is 12% more compare to H Glass, Impact on BOM by reducing the blade mass by 12% in ML area. 2.5% lighter blades is achieved to meet the customer demand with a better quality
